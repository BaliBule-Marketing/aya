They do not create persistent pollution in water or soil and are considered a gentler alternative for ecosystems and for the human body.</p><p><br/></p><p>Each shade created through botanical dyeing is <strong>alive</strong>.</p><p>It is shaped by the season, the water, temperature, duration of the process, and the character of the fabric itself. Because of this, color can never be fully replicated — <strong>every piece is unique</strong>, just like the moment in which it was made.</p><p><strong>Color that breathes</strong></p><p>Botanical dyes do not sit on the surface of the fabric — they <strong>interact with the fiber</strong>, creating depth, soft transitions, and natural gradients. Over time, the color may evolve, deepen, and develop a patina — much like skin, wood, or stone.</p><p>We see this not as wear, but as <strong>the natural aging of a living material</strong>.</p><p><strong>Close to the body</strong></p><p>AYA garments are dyed to be worn close to the skin.</p><p>While we do not make medical claims, we consciously avoid aggressive synthetic dyes and choose a path with <strong>less petrochemical origin and more natural sources</strong>.</p><p>For those with sensitive skin, we recommend washing the garment before first wear.</p><p><strong>Color as a choice for the future</strong></p><p>We believe the future of fashion is not speed, but depth.</p><p>Botanical dyes require time, care, and human presence — and that is precisely why they represent <strong>a more conscious and sustainable language of color</strong>, one that does not harm the Earth, but returns to it.</p>",
